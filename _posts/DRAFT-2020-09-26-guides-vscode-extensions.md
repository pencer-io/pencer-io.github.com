This is the third post in a series of articles, that are aimed at showing you simple step by step guides for creating your own static website hosted on GitHub for free. This post focuses on a few useful extensions I use with VSCode. These give me a comfortable working environment, and some of the shortcuts really speed things up.

The starting point for this series of guides is [here](https://pencer.io/guides/web-creating-free-blog/). The first article explaining how to set up a GitHub account is [here.](https://pencer.io/guides/web-getting-started-github/) in case you need to do that. The second article which goes through installing VSCode and Git is [here.](https://pencer.io/guides/web-vscode-git/)

## VSCode Extensions overview

One of the reasons why VSCode has become so popular is it's versatility. With the addition of a few selected extensions, you can change your environment from a Python playground to a writing suite. It's quick and simple to install extensions, and looking over the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) you'll see there are hundreds to choose from. 

Microsoft has a good guide to the Extension Marketplace [here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)

Below I show you the extensions I've used to give me a comfortable writing environment. I do all of my writing in VSCode, and couldn't be happier with it.
